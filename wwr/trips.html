                        <p>
                            The Middle Fork Canyon is perfect for the experienced rafter or for the more adventurous first timer! 
                            Participants should be reasonably athletic, in good physical condition, and are required to know how to swim. 
                            It is a true wilderness river...dazzling, clear water flowing through a backdrop of green, densely forested canyon walls, 
                            rising 2000' overhead.Side streams form natural pools and waterfalls to play in and enjoy on multi-day trips. Spectacular 
                            scenery combines with numerous Class III and Class IV rapids in this secluded canyon to create a California river experience 
                            that is hard to match.

                            CLASS I - X: The Middle Fork Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon are technically rated I - X (
                            1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances. However, most people are familiar with the
                            regular I - V river rating scale, so we often refer to both.
